To run this code 
1. write npm intall in the terminal



This code will allow the user to start their React Portfolio and customize it to their experiences and projects. When I first started creating my own portfolio it was a horror show. 
I didn't know where to start. So I decided to create my own and help others who also feel intimated by starting their own portfolios. 

I hope this helps you just as it helped me land my first job.
